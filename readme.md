# README for Micro-controller-Slides in branch main

* This repository mainly to create a slideset for a short talk, which I already held for some colleagues.
* It consists of two branches, a branch __main__ and a branch __gh_pages__
* The branch __gh_pages__ is mainly to create the Slides and publish them to a Web-Page for HTML-Slides
* The branch __main__ is more or less useless and should contain only some short explanation like THIS readme.

## Slides itself 

* are in slides.md in the branch __gh_pages__
* on commit will be published to : https://jogi-k.github.io/micro-controller-slides/
